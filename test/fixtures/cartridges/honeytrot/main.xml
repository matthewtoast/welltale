  <p>You're playing Honeytrot, by Matthew Trost.</p>

  <sleep duration="2000" />

  <p>This story takes place in 1992 - before much of what we call the internet existed.</p>
  <p>There were no apps, no smartphones, no social media, and the World Wide Web was just a handful of modest pages of text.</p>
  <p>Even in the relatively technologically advanced world of espionage, field work was still the staple of intelligence gathering: meeting contacts in abandoned parks, taking surreptitious photos, installing wiretaps, listening into conversations.</p>
  <p>But, times were changing in the secret world, too. The Cold War had just ended - formally, at least - and many former intelligence personnel now found themselves involuntarily retired.</p>
  <p>Some of these ex-agents, ex-fixers, and ex-officers chose to close their clandestine chapter for good, and return to their modest lives and families.</p>
  <p>Others fell into despair, now lacking a sense of purpose that could match what their former missions of global importance had provided.</p>
  <p>Still others saw opportunities. The unremitting force of capitalism teased of great personal reward, new and more extreme forms of leverage, and unexplored avenues for betrayal.</p>

    Before your story begins, you'll need to choose a code name.
    It can be a normal name, or just a word you like the sound of.
    Take a moment to think about it.

  <p>Now then. What is your code name?</p>
