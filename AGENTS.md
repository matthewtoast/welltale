# Instructions

Read README.md first.

## General

- Keep code simple, minimal, and DRY
- Keep variable names short
- Write modular, elegant code
- Don't add comments
- Ask clarifying questions before making changes
- Use pure functions with explicit arguments
- Prefer early return over conditional
- Array properties should default to empty arrays, not `null`
- Prefer libraries' own types over writing your own
- Don't create classes (unless instructed)
- When researching APIs and docs, use latest content (2025)
- Put reusable/generic utility functions in separate files

## JavaScript & TypeScript

- Use yarn (not npm)
- Run yarn typecheck after changes to check for type errors
- Use function declaration style (`function foo() {...}`)
- Never use 'any' type
- Don't add try/catch blocks
- Don't throw; instead, log warning and return `null`
- Avoid optional?: function arguments or object properties
