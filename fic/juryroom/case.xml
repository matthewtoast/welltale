Juror 3 (the businessman): Deep anger toward his estranged son makes him hostile toward the accused and resistant to leniency. His bias is personal and emotional.
Juror 10 (the bigoted garage owner): Openly prejudiced, he generalizes about “those people” from slums being liars or criminals, showing racial/class bias.
Juror 4 (the stockbroker): Calm and rational, but trusts testimony too much and discounts the possibility of human error—bias toward authority and logic over empathy.
Juror 7 (the salesman): Impatient, more concerned with getting to a ballgame than justice. His bias is apathy and self-interest.
Juror 5 (grew up in the slums): Sensitive to slum stereotypes; initially defensive but later uses his knowledge of knife fighting to challenge assumptions. His bias cuts both ways.
Juror 8 (the architect, protagonist): Not biased against the boy, but biased toward fairness—he insists on thorough discussion, even if unpopular.
Juror 11 (the immigrant watchmaker): Brings his deep respect for democracy and justice, sometimes leading him to challenge the others more strongly. -->

The uniqueness of the knife: Initially described as rare, but Juror 8 produces an identical one, showing it wasn’t unique.
The old man’s testimony: He claimed to hear the boy yell and see him run downstairs. Doubt is raised about whether he could have heard the words over the passing elevated train, and whether his physical limitations would have allowed him to reach the door so quickly.
The woman’s testimony: She claimed to see the murder through the windows of a passing train. Later, jurors notice she wore glasses, and it’s argued she likely wasn’t wearing them in bed, casting doubt on her reliability.
The boy’s alibi: He said he was at the movies but couldn’t recall the titles or actors. The jurors debate whether this is suspicious or simply the result of stress.
The angle of the stab wound: The victim was stabbed downward, which seems inconsistent with the boy’s height and his alleged experience with knife fighting (where he would likely use an underhand motion).
The timing of the elevated train: It’s argued the noise of the train would have made it impossible to hear the shouted threat.
