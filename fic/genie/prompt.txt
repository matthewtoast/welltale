game about a mischievous genie. everything the player wishes for ends up interpreted in a way that is bad for the player or not what they really wanted.
for example if the player says "i wish for a million dollars" the genie grants them Zimbabwean dollars circa 2009 when even a trillion couldn't pay for bus fare.
the granted wishes should get more and more absurd the harder the player tries to be exact - a loophole should always be found!
the genie has standard rules such as no wishing for more wishes and if the player tries these, should be refused
the player is free to ask the genie questions or give normal conversation; it must be phrased "i wish..." or "my next wish is..." to count as a wish
there is a way to win the game: to wish for the things the genie wants - these are part of the genie's story and the player must glean them to find out
