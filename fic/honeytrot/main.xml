    Itâ€™s 1994.
    After the Cold War ended, you, like so many others who worked in intelligence, returned to civilian life.
    You said goodbye to the secrecy, the bureaucracy, and the unshakeable feeling that you were just a pawn.
    But the secret world, the world of espionage, continued on. You were content leaving it all behind... until you received the phone call.
    The voice on the line was someone you hadn't heard from for years.

    {{playerName}}. [hesitant] It's good to hear your voice.
    [awkward] Listen, there's... something I need your help with.
    [serious] I need you to meet me - today. The usual spot, near my office.
    I know you said you were walking away for good, but...
  </p>

  <p from="Clyde" id="jacobson-begs">
    I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent and important. Will you meet me?

    I'm happy to see you again {{playerName}}. [pause] You look good.
    [awkward] Well... Look, let me just cut to the chase.
    [businesslike] We need your help on a tight turnaround.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    I hesitated to call you because [awkward] maybe the call wouldn't be welcome.
    But this is a job where I can only ask someone I have complete trust in.
    [confident] At the end of the day, that's you.

    So. The target is a 42-year-old white male named Wesley Tidus.
    Marital status: Single, never married. Occupation: computer systems analyst at Funtronics, the toy company.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    We've only had two days to surveil him, but the picture we get is a man dedicated to his work.
    He lives in a studio apartment, orders delivery 6 nights a week, and enjoys the company of toy prototypes more than people.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    Although he doesn't socialize, we did find something interesting in the garbage analysis.
    It was a $49.99 receipt for registration in a service called LoveCassette. It's a video matchmaking service.
    That's where you come in.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    As we speak, LoveCassette's scheduling system is being updated to show that Mr. Tidus has a date with a {{playerGender}} named {{playerName}}, tonight at 7pm.
    I think you understand.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    The mission will be simple. We're going to outfit you with a wire, and you're to get Tidus talking.
    The wire will be connected to a radio uplink at a nearby control van. Aphid will be recording the whole conversation.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    What we need is a recording of Tidus saying each of nine different designated words.
    We'll provide you with the list of the nine words he needs to say.
    How you get him to say each word will be up to your talent and discretion. But we need him to clearly say all nine words.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    That's the basics. Now, what questions do you have?
