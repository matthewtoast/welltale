    Itâ€™s 1994.
    After the Cold War ended, you, like so many others who worked in intelligence, returned to civilian life.
    You said goodbye to the secrecy, the bureaucracy, and - most of all - the unshakeable feeling that you were just a pawn.
    But the secret world, the world of espionage, continued just the same. You were content leaving it all behind...
    Until you received the phone call. The voice on the line was someone you hadn't heard for years.

    {{playerName}}. [hesitant] It's great to hear your voice.
    [awkward] Listen, there's... something at work I really need your input on.
    [serious] I'm wondering if you can meet me for lunch - today - to discuss. The usual spot, near my office.
    I know you said you were walking away for good, but...
  </p>

  <p from="Clyde" id="jacobson-begs">
    I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent and important. Will you meet me?

    Thanks, {{playerName}}. I'll owe you a favor.
    See you soon.

  <p from="Clyde">
    I'm happy to see you again {{playerName}}. [pause] You look good.
    [awkward] Well... Look, let me just cut to the chase.
    [businesslike] We need your help on a pretty tight turnaround.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    I admit, I hesitated to call you because, well... [awkward] maybe the call wouldn't be welcome.
    But, due to the nature of this job, I can only ask someone I have complete trust in.
    [confident] And, at the end of the day, that's you.

    The target is a 42-year-old white male named Wesley Tidus.
    Martial status: Single, never married.
    Occupation: computer systems analyst at Funtronics. Yes, the toy company.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    Now, we've only had two days to surveil him, but the picture we get is a man dedicated to his work.
    He lives in a studio apartment, orders delivery 6 or more nights a week, and seems to enjoy the company of toy prototypes more than people.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    Although he doesn't socialize, we did find one sign of normal human life - when we did the usual garbage analysis.
    What we found was a $49.99 receipt for registration in a service called LoveCassette. It's a video matchmaking service.
    That's where you come in.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    As we speak, LoveCassette's scheduling system is being updated to show that Mr. Tidus has a date with a {{playerGender}} named {{playerName}}, tonight at 7pm.
    I know it's not much time to prepare, but - like I said, tight turnaround.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    The mission will be simple. We're going to outfit you with a wire, and you're to get Tidus talking.
    The wire will be connected to a radio uplink at a nearby control van. Aphid will be recording the whole conversation.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    What we need is a recording of Tidus saying each of nine different designated words.
    We'll provide you with the list.
    How you get him to say each word will be up to your talent and discretion. But we need him to clearly say all nine.
  </p>
  <p from="Clyde">
    That's the basics. Now, what questions of yours can I answer to make sure this mission is successful?
