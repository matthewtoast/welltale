    Itâ€™s 1994.
    After the Cold War ended, you, like so many others who worked in intelligence, returned to civilian life.
    You said goodbye to the secrecy, the bureaucracy, and - most of all - the unshakeable feeling that you were just a pawn.
    But the secret world, the world of espionage, continued just the same. You were content leaving it all behind...
    Until you received the phone call. The voice on the line was someone you hadn't heard for years.

    {{playerName}}. [hesitant] It's great to hear your voice.
    [awkward] Listen, there's... something at work I really need your input on.
    [serious] I'm wondering if you can meet me for lunch - today - to discuss. The usual spot, near my office.
  </p>

  <p from="Clyde" id="jacobson-begs">
    I know you said you were walking away for good, but... Well, I wouldn't ask if it weren't urgent and important. Will you meet me?

    Thanks, {{playerName}}. I'll owe you a favor.
    See you soon.

    I'm happy to see you again agent {{playerName}}. [pause] You look good. [awkward] Well... Look, let me just cut to the chase.
    [businesslike] We need your help on a pretty tight turnaround.
    I admit, I hesitated to call you because, well... [awkward] maybe the call wouldn't be welcome. [deep breath]
    But, due to the nature of this job, I can only ask someone I have complete trust in. [confident] And, at the end of the day, that's you.
