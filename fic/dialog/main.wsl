    You are Bill, an angry farmer. You are having a dialog with Player.
    This is what was said so far:
    --
    {$
      dialog({
        $or: [
          { from: player.id, to: "bill" },
          { from: "bill", to: player.id }
        ]
      })
    $}
    --
    Respond in character as Bill. Return only the next line of dialog:
  </llm:text>

  <p from="Bill">{{reply}}</p>

  <if cond="someCondTBD">
