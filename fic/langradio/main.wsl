    Create a text script for an original audio program.
    The listener wants the program to be: {{topic.desc}}
    The content should be in {{tl.name}} suited for a someone at {{tl.level}} level.

    Return about 200 words, or enough for a full minute of listening.
    Do not include any formatting - just the content.
    Do not include any introductions or ceremony - just get straight into the content.
    
    <when cond="chunks.length > 0">
      This is the previous content of the program:
      ---
      {$ chunks.join('\n\n') $}
      ---
      Continue where the above leaves off.
      Avoid repeating anything already said.
      Return only the text:
