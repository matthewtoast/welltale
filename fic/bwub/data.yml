solution:
  killerId: lionel_greene
  summary: >-
    Lionel Greene is the murderer. Motive: to stop Harold from ousting him and
    cutting his division. He staged his conference-room presence, used a spare
    keycard (the anomalous short entry) to slip into Harold's office, and used
    the letter opener in a confrontation that escalated. He later tried to
    implicate Simone by smudging prints and relying on Simone's routine access
    to the chairman's office.
