  Your target's name is Steven Warner.
  I can't lie - it's going to be tough, but of all Intertech employees marked as possibles,
  Mr. Warner is the only who has high enough security clearance to get us access to the R&amp;D wing.
  Here's what we know about him. 42 years old, been working at InterTech since he graduated
  with a Ph.D in robotics at age 22. You heard that right. Intelligent, focused, and meticulously organized.
  This guy's garbage is pristine. Even his used-up toothpaste tube was washed and folded.
  He does have one weak point, though. He's unmarried and, evidently looking for a partner.
  He has an active profile on a the Doorways dating app. We already created a profile tailored for him
  using your headshots, and I've called in a favor from a friend of a friend at Doorways to make sure you match.
  My team handle getting the first date. You'll be sent all the chat logs, of course.
  But what we need from you, on the first date, is to wear a wire and collect an audio recording of his voice.
  You see, InterTech uses a voice-based passphrase system. To access what Mr. Warner can access, we need his voice.
  But not just his voice - a very particular passphrase. The passphrase is
  "My name is Steven Warner, my voice is my passport. Verify me."
  Now, we don't need him to say this whole phrase. All we need are the words, in any order.
  My team can splice it together after. But we do need all 9 unique words.
  So, your job is to get him talking. Ideally in an environment with low background noise.
  Once we have all the words recorded, it's up to you how to end the date.
  And keep in mind we have a time window here. There can't be a second date.
  Use your wit and charm to make sure he says every word on the list.
  Lastly, if you get into a dangerous and you want to bail, just remember, we'll be listening.
  Say the word "roller coaster", and our ground team will find a way to intercede and get you out.

  We went through Warner's garbage and found some interesting items.
  He goes through about a box of cereal every day, a different one each time.
  The man loves cereal, if that can be an advantage, use it.
  On the flip side, we also found a hard drive.
  Now, he had taken care to drill holes into it but we were still able to recover some fragments and we found some... interesting material.
  It appears he may have something of a foot fetish.
  Much of the photography we found featured red nail polish.
  However, be careful about using this information.
  If played wrong it could go south quickly.
  If he suspects he's being extorted he might leave or alert InterTech.
  I trust you to make the right judgment call.
